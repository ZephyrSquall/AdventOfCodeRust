    // This puzzle required making some extreme assumptions about the puzzle input. By stepping
    // through my puzzle input step-by-step and mapping out the logic, I determined that the initial
    // values in the b and c registers define an inclusive lower and upper bound for a range of
    // values, which are offset from each other by a hardcoded value in the "sub b -<SOME VALUE>"
    // instruction on the second-last line (e.g. if b is 4, c is 10, and the hardcoded value is 2,
    // the values that the program would iterate over are be 4, 6, 8, 10). For each of these values,
    // it sets register f to 1, then it creates a sub-loop using register d, which itself has its
    // own sub-loop using register e, both of which count from 2 to the current value. In every
    // iteration of the innermost loop, it checks if d*e - b == 0, and if this is true, it sets f to
    // 0. Once the outer sub-loop completes, if f was set to 0, register h is incremented by 1.
    //
    // The condition d*e = b == 0 is equivalent to d*e == b. If this is never true, then register f
    // remains set to 1 and h isn't incremented; if it is true at least one time, then register f is
    // set to 0 and h gets incremented. As such, for each value, the program essentially asks "Does
    // there exist any two integers which are both greater than or equal to 2, such that their
    // product equals the given value?" This is equivalent to asking if the given value is a
    // composite number (a positive integer other than 1 which is not a prime number). As such, what
    // the program ultimately does is count every composite number within the set of numbers defined
    // by the bounds of registers b and c and the hardcoded offset, and stores the count in register
    // h.
    //
    // I assume this is the intended trick of the puzzle, and that every puzzle input is set up to
    // follow the rules described above. As such, my solution searches the program in the puzzle
    // input for every line that modifies registers b or c, executes all of them except for the last
    // one, assumes the values for b and c I end up with are the initial values for them, and
    // assumes the literal argument to the last instruction instead defines the offset. I ignore all
    // other lines in the puzzle input, assuming that the rest of it is just implementation details
    // for counting composite numbers. I use the extracted b, c, and offset values to set up the
    // full list of values, then use my own implementation for counting composite numbers. If any of
    // the assumptions I have made for this solution are incorrect, then my solution might not work
    // for all possible puzzle inputs.
