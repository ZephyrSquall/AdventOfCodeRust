    //  - Each "level" of the loop repeats four times, on the right, top, left, and bottom edges.
    //      After the bottom edge, the loop extends outwards and the next loop begins.
    //  - The maximum Manhattan Distance of a loop (which occurs at a corner) is double the minimum
    //      Manhattan Distance of a loop (which occurs when directly right of, above, left of, or
    //      below 1)
    //  - Each loop starts at one less than its maximum Manhattan Distance (as it starts one space
    //      above the lower-right corner). From there, it steps down until it reaches half the
    //      maximum Manhattan Distance of that loop (directly right of the 1), then steps up until
    //      it reaches the maximum value (the upper-right corner of the loop), then repeats this
    //      process three more times to traverse the other three sides of the loop.
    //  - The maximum Manhattan Distance of a loop is 2 more than the maximum Manhattan Distance of
    //      the previous loop, as the corners are further away one step horizontally and one step
    //      vertically.
    //  - The maximum Manhattan Distance of the innermost loop (starting from the 2) is 2.
    //  - The previous two points mean the maximum Manhattan Distance is always an even number, so
    //      the minimum Manhattan Distance of a loop (which is half of the maximum) is always a
    //      whole number.

    // Unlike last time, storing the previous numbers seems necessary. However, there are still some
    // observations that can make it possible to use merely a vector of the spiral numbers in order
    // for this task (as opposed to a 2D data structure).
    //  - There are four distinct cases: When on a corner of a loop, immediately before the corner
    //      of a loop, immediately after the corner of a loop, or anywhere else along the edge of a
    //      loop. (The first and second 1s in the data don't fall neatly into any of these four
    //      cases and technically form a fifth and sixth case (zero adjacent numbers and one
    //      adjacent number). Because no other numbers share these cases, it is simpler to just skip
    //      these cases by hardcoding the first and second numbers.)
    //  - If the index of the orthogonally-adjacent number in the inner loop is tracked, then it is
    //      possible to determine the index of every adjacent number in each of the four cases, and
    //      whether or not the index should be incremented to remain in sync, by following these
    //      rules:
    //       - On a regular edge (not a corner or one off from a corner): The adjacent squares are
    //           the immediately preceding value, the value at the index, the value immediately
    //           before that index, and the value immediately after that index. Increment the index
    //           after this step.
    //       - Immediately before a corner: The adjacent squares are the immediately preceding
    //           value, the value at the index, and the value immediately before the index. Do not
    //           increment the index after this step.
    //       - On a corner: The adjacent squares are the immediately preceding value and the value
    //           at the index (which is diagonally adjacent instead of orthogonally adjacent because
    //           the index wasn't incremented last step). Do not increment the index after this
    //           step.
    //       - Immediately after a corner: The adjacent squares are the two preceding values, the
    //           value at the index (which is again aligned orthogonally since the index wasn't
    //           incremented after the last two steps), and the value immediately after that index.
    //           Increment the index after this step.
    //  - The length of an edge increases by 1 after every second edge. This is because each loop
    //      lasts four edges and the edge length increases by two after each two, however the way
    //      one loop leads into the next causes the last edge of the inner loop to be one step
    //      longer than normal and the first edge of the outer loop to be one step shorter than
    //      normal.
