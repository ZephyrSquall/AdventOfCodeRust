    // Note that due to the way Rust's Vec::insert() method pushes the value at the current index
    // forward, the very initial push ends up moving 0 to the end of the array. From here on, if a
    // value were to be inserted immediately after the 0, the index would wrap around to the front
    // of the array before inserting, thus the 0 will always remain at the end of the array. This
    // quirk doesn't affect the relative order of any element (the Rust vector matches the circular
    // buffer as defined in the puzzle after the elements are rotated by 1), it just means the value
    // after 0 is actually at index 0 because the buffer wraps around.
